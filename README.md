## Overview

This project aims to explore Spotify trends using data from the Spotify Songs 2023 dataset obtained from the Kaggle API. The dataset is enriched with additional data using the Spotify Developer API, including images of songs. The enriched dataset is then utilized to create an interactive Power BI report that provides a detailed overview of Spotify trends.

## Project Details

1. **Downloading Spotify Songs 2023 Dataset:**
   - Utilized the Kaggle API to download the Spotify Songs 2023 dataset.

2. **Enriching Dataset with Spotify Developer API:**
   - Enhanced the dataset with additional data obtained from the Spotify Developer API, including images of songs.

3. **Creating Interactive Power BI Report:**
   - Developed an interactive Power BI report to analyze and visualize Spotify trends based on the enriched dataset.
